# LSEPI Concerns:

## Issue Outline:

### Legal:

- Ensure that the program complies with data protection laws and environmental laws when appropriate. This would also include legislation regarding the environmental field.
- Ensure that the program does not hold the capacity to be used for criminal purposes i.e generating false environment reports or breaching environmental law.
- Ensure that an up-to-date record is kept in regards to data processing and any legal issues in regard to said data. Said legal issues would require fast follow ups and responses.

### Security:

- Ensuring that the application has implemented technological and legal measures to ensure that data is not being deleted, stolen or misused in any way that breaches the GDPR or Data Protection Act. 
- Regular security checks of the code- Upkeep.
- Implementing a permission based system on both the front and back-ends respectively, ensuring that both the database and application have permission levels that are accessed through login details. (Going further with this concept would include measures such as two factor authentication).

### Ethics:

- Ensuring that the program does not discriminate against those who may be less abled. (Following a11y and other accessibility standards within the design).
- Consider the ethical ramifications of either notifying the government about serious environmental hazards and pollution or breaking company-client confidentiality as this would be a conflict of interest. Could pose ethical issues, possible breaches of environmental law depending how it's handled.
- Ensuring that the program will not optimize environmental data for the purpose of hiding or ignoring environmental issues (Fixing a form of pollution or land damage to the point where it's legal, but not sustainable for the environment, for example).

### Interoperability:

- Ensuring that the program can integrate with other programs the clients may use: Ensuring users can upload files from other applications such as Excel, containing their environmental information as opposed to manually inputting information within the application itself.
- Making sure the application uses the industry standard in file formats to ensure smooth data exchange.
- Take into account compatability issues that may stem from the program when faced with other programs and workflows (Unsupported file formats for data importation etc).

## Action plan (How are we going to use this knowledge in the production of the program):
